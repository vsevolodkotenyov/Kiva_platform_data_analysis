# Providing EDA for KIVA.org's financial data with Python (pd, np, plt, sns)
In this work I have made an attempt to provide data analysis on KIVA.org's open-source statistics. 
The keh hypothesis: relatively poor countries with underdeveloped financial institutions have a more vivid tendency to apply for microloans from KIVA
Based on the results of EDA, the hypothesis was accepted.
